# Basics in java

Java is a programming language and a platform. Java is a high level, robust, object-oriented and secure programming language.

Java was developed by Sun Microsystems (which is now the subsidiary of Oracle) in the year 1995.

## Platform

Any hardware or software environment in which a program runs, is known as a platform. Since Java has a runtime environment (JRE) and API, it is called a platform.

## Important points

- Java is platform-independent.
- Java is mainly used for application programming.

- Java was designed and created as an interpreter for printing systems but later extended as a support network computing. It was designed to be easy to use and accessible to a broader audience.

- Java doesn't support the goto statement.

- Java doesn't support multiple inheritance through class. It can be achieved by using interfaces in java.

- Java doesn't support operator overloading.
- Java supports pointer internally. However, you can't write the pointer program in java. It means java has restricted pointer support in java.

- Java supports call by value only. There is no call by reference in java.

- Java doesn't support structures and unions.
- Java has built-in thread support.
- Java has no virtual keyword. We can override all non-static methods by default. In other words, non-static methods are virtual by default.

- Java is not so interactive with hardware.

### Compiler and Interpreter

C++ uses compiler only. C++ is compiled and run using the compiler which converts source code into machine code so, C++ is platform dependent.
Java uses both compiler and interpreter. Java source code is converted into bytecode at compilation time. The interpreter executes this bytecode at runtime and produces output. Java is interpreted that is why it is platform-independent.
