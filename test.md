# Object-Oriented Programming System

Object means a real-world entity such as a pen, chair, table, computer, watch, etc. Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects. It simplifies software development and maintenance by providing some concepts:

- Object
- Class
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation

The main aim of object-oriented programming is to implement real-world entities.

## Object

An entity that has state and behavior is known as an object e.g., chair, bike, marker, pen, table, car, etc. It can be physical or logical (tangible and intangible). The example of an intangible object is the banking system.

An object has three characteristics:

- **State**: represents the data (value) of an object.
- **Behavior**: represents the behavior (functionality) of an object such as deposit, withdraw, etc.
- **Identity**: An object identity is typically implemented via a unique ID. The value of the ID is not visible to the external user. However, it is used internally by the JVM to identify each object uniquely.

An object is an instance of a class. A class is a template or blueprint from which objects are created.

## Class

A class is a group of objects which have common properties. It is a template or blueprint from which objects are created. It is a logical entity and can't be physical.

A class in Java can contain:

- Fields
- Methods: expose the behavior of an object.
- Constructors
- Blocks
- Nested class and interface

### Instance variable in Java

A variable which is created inside the class but outside the method is known as an instance variable. Instance variable doesn't get memory at compile time. It gets memory at runtime when an object or instance is created. That is why it is known as an instance variable.
